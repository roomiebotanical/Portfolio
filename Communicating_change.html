            <p>For this project, I took part in a two-day intensive program to make on-site communication for drivers in
                Aachen clearer. The city introduced a new block system to improve traffic flow, but a lot of people
                found it confusing. We looked at what users actually needed, tested different ideas, and came up with
                better ways to guide drivers through the new system.

            <h4>Problem:</h4>
            <p>The City of Aachen introduced a new block system to improve traffic flow and enhance the quality of life
                in the city center. However, the current way of communicating these changes wasn’t clear to all
                motorists. Some found it confusing, while others felt it was an attempt to push cars out of the city,
                negatively impacting shop owners.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="verticalstripe"></div>
        <div class="solution">
            <h4>Solution:</h4>
            <p>People in Aachen weren’t aware of the changes, and those who were didn’t always want to adapt. Many felt
                excluded from the decision-making process or didn’t see the benefits for themselves. The key question we
                tackled: Why does something need to change in your communication. We created a poster series with
                emotional storytelling to make the impact of the new system more relatable. Instead of just presenting
                facts, we highlighted the perspectives of different people in Aachen, showing their unique needs and how
                the changes could improve their daily lives.</p>

        <p> <span class="bold_blue"> Day 1:</span> We took a tour of the city of Aachen and were informed about the
            problems the city was facing. They have since changed the system, so now, as a driver, you will always be
            guided to the outer ring. There are signs that communicate this: you need to know which area you're going to
            and then stay on the outer ring until you reach that area. The idea is not to drive through the city center.

            <p>There are also some pain points. For example, at this intersection, they want you to turn left, but
                people still go straight, either because of old habits or because they don't understand the new system.
                We were also told that the police don't monitor this area because the situation is too confusing.</p>

    <div class="alleen-tekst">
        <p> We spoke to people on the streets, starting with tourists, as they were our target group. They told us that
            they had no trouble driving around Aachen; they just followed Google Maps, and it was easy. Of course,
            that's nice, but maybe they don’t realize they’re driving down the wrong street. So, we stayed at the
            intersection for a while and observed that most of the people going the wrong way were locals from Aachen.
            We also spoke to some of them, and they said that they’re aware of the new rules but don’t follow them
            because there’s no enforcement, and they’ve just gotten used to old habits.

        <p> <span class="bold_blue"> Day 2:</span> On this day, we worked on our ideas and came up with a solution. We
            concluded that the problem is that people don’t understand why things are changing or what the benefits are.
            That’s why we created posters with emotional storytelling to explain why these changes are important.
