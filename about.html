                <!-- <p>
                    I’m naturally curious and love making connections—between ideas, people, and perspectives.
                    I thrive in environments where I can contribute to meaningful projects that have a real impact.
                    To me, good design isn’t just about aesthetics; it should feel intuitive, accessible, and seamlessly
                    fit into people’s lives.
                </p>
                <br> -->
                <p>I've been creative for as long as I can remember—drawing, coloring, looming, sewing. When my father
                    started a photography course during my early high school years and Photoshop appeared on his laptop,
                    I was immediately intrigued. I followed YouTube tutorials on photo editing and started taking
                    pictures of animals, even creating a book filled with dog portraits. This passion led me to study
                    photography as my first major.
                    During that program, we also had courses in Graphic Design and 3D, and I quickly realized that I
                    enjoyed those even more than photography. That’s when I decided to switch to <span
                        class="bold_red">Communication and Multimedia Design</span> (CMD).
                    In my free time, I love knitting. It’s a slow craft, and I enjoy immersing myself in something that
                    takes time to create.</p>

                <h2>What I Can Do</h2>

                <p>
                    My background in photography has given me a deep understanding of visual composition, lighting, and
                    storytelling. But over time, I discovered that my true passion lies in other areas of design.
                    I have extensive experience with various design tools, including Photoshop, Illustrator, Figma,
                    InDesign, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. While having technical skills is valuable, <span
                        class="bold_red">I believe that design is about much more than just the tools.</span>
                    What truly excites me is understanding people. I have a strong ability to empathize with different
                    audiences, recognize patterns, and make meaningful connections. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <span class="bold_blue">
                        This is also why I’m drawn to the Bauhaus philosophy. Bauhaus design is about functionality,
                        clarity, and reducing things to their essence. It combines art and technology in a way that
                        makes information accessible and beautiful. This approach deeply influences my work, especially
                        in data visualization, where simplifying complex information is key.</span>

            <h2>What I want
                </h2>
            <p>
                Recently, I’ve become fascinated by data visualization. This interest started during our visit to Ellery Studio in Berlin. Their work in visual storytelling supports change, provides direction, and inspires people to take action. One of their books, Future Ahoy! An Infographic Novel About Sustainable Transport, showed me how data can be transformed into engaging and impactful visuals.
                Following that experience, I worked on a project for the Dutch Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS), where we created a multimedia story about logistics and transportation. This project was incredibly fulfilling—I saw firsthand how data can tell compelling stories when presented effectively.

                <br>
                <span class="bold_blue">
                 Now, I want to dive deeper into this field and explore how data visualization works in practice. That’s why I’m looking for an internship where I can learn how these processes unfold in the real world.</p></span>
